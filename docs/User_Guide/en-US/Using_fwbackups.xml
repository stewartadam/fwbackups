	<section id="sect-fwbackups-User_Guide-Using_fwbackups-Backup_types">
		<title>Backup types</title>
		<para>
			<application>fwbackups</application> supports two main types of backups: recurring backups that automatically backup your files on a schedule, and backups that are run once and not scheduled again. These are referred to as as <emphasis>backup sets</emphasis> and <emphasis>one-time backups</emphasis> respectively.
		</para>
		<para>
			You will be able to configure any number of backup sets, each backing up on a regular schedule at a time of your choice. Each set operates independently, so if you wish you may group files into two or more sets and have them backup at different times or to different destination folders. You may also perform one-time, however in this case the backup will not be scheduled to start again in the future.
		</para>
		<important>
			<title>When to use set or one-time backups</title>
			<para>
				It is recommended that you create a backup set for your important files in order to ensure that you have a recent backup copy saved at all times. One-time backups are more suitable for making backups of large files, such as a music collection or video that you may not want to include in a backup set that is started daily or weekly.
			</para>

			<title>Paths</title>
			<para>
				The paths tab allows you to select which files and folder are to be included in the backup. To add files, click <guibutton>Add File</guibutton> or <guibutton>Add Folder</guibutton>. If you wish to remove a file or folder from the backup, select one or more paths from the list and click <guibutton>Remove</guibutton>.
			</para>
			<para>
				Each path in the list will have either a green or red icon next to it. A green icon indicates that <application>fwbackups</application> is able to read path, while a red icon indicates that the file is missing or unable to read the path and it may be excluded from future backups.
			</para>

		<section id="sect-fwbackups-User_Guide-Creating_a_backup_set-Destination">
			<title>Destination</title>
			<para>
				The destination tab controls where your backup will be saved to. You may choose to backup to a local drive, removable storage or a remote computer supporting the SFTP protocol (if your computer runs the OpenSSH server, it most likely supports SFTP).

					If you choose to backup to a remote host, be sure to click <guibutton>Test Settings</guibutton> before saving your set! A typo in the password (and other fields) can leave <application>fwbackups</application> unable to connect to to the remote host, resulting in a failed backup.

		<section id="sect-fwbackups-User_Guide-Creating_a_backup_set-Times">
			<title>Times</title>
			<para>
				This tab controls the time and date at which the backup should be started at. Both easy configuration and manual configuration (crontab) methods are supported. Using the easy configuration is recommended for most users.
			</para>
			<para>
				The easy configuration uses a series of drop-down boxes, and sliders to determine at which time fwbackups should schedule a backup. A backup of the set is run whenever the date matches the chosen parameters. That being said, be careful when selecting the minute for your backup operation! A common user error is choosing <guilabel>Every minute</guilabel> for the backup time, causing a a new backup to start at every minute of the hour. It is recommended instead to choose a specific minute at which the backup will start at, for example "0" (at the beginning of the hour) or "30" (for half-way through the hour).

			<para>
				If you wish to further customize the times at which the backup operation starts, you may use the manual configuration method to do so. It uses crontab syntax:
			</para>

<literallayout>							+-------------- minute (0 - 59)
						|	+------------ hour (0 - 23)
						|	 |	+---------- day of month (1 - 31)
						|	 |	 |	+-------- month (1 - 12)

						|	 |	 |	 |	 |		 +-- command to run
						|	 |	 |	 |	 |			|
						*	 *	 *	 *	 *	command
</literallayout>
			<para>
				Simply enter the same values you would into a crontab, as outlined above, into the designated entry boxes. Please note that you cannot enter all five fields onto one line; the four fields are divided among four different entry boxes. As well, it is important to note that in manual configuration mode <emphasis>no validation is performed on user input</emphasis> and you must supply valid values for the first five fields. The sixth field, used for the command, is generated automatically by fwbackups.

				<varlistentry id="varl-fwbackups-User_Guide-Options_Simple-Backup_Format">
					<term>Backup Format</term>

						<para>
							Your backup will be stored differently depending on the backup format selected (this option replaces the <guilabel>Backup Engine</guilabel> selection in versions 1.43.2 and earlier).
						</para>
						<para>
							An <guilabel>Archive</guilabel> backup packs all of the files into a single (often large) "tar" archive file. Archive backups do not support incremental backups; a full snapshot must be created each time. Archive backups support both gzip and bzip2 on-the-fly compression. This backup format was formerly called the "tar" backup engine (".gz" or ".bz2" was appended if gzip or bzip2 compression was enabled, respectively).
							<note>
								<title>Reducing backup size with compression</title>
								<para>
									Enabling compression will utilize more system resources during the backup, but results in smaller file sizes. <emphasis>gzip</emphasis> is a relatively lightweight compression with a good compression ratio. If you would like to further reduce the size of your backups, consider switching to <emphasis>bzip2</emphasis> compression. Although it is much slower than gzip, bzip2 is able to achieve smaller file sizes.
								</para>

							</note>

						</para>
						<para>
							A <guilabel>Direct copy</guilabel> backup will simply copy your files and folder structure as-is (similar to a drag-and-drop copy in your file browser). Although this backup type does not support compression, incremental backups are available. This backup format was formerly called the "rsync" backup engine.
							<note>
								<title>Increasing backup speed</title>
								<para>
									Enabling the <guibutton>Backups are incremental</guibutton> option will run an incremental backup instead of a full one, copying only the changes since your last backup. Currently, the incremental backups are only available for set backups on Unix-like platforms (such as Linux and OS X) and cannot be used when backing up to a remote host.
								</para>
								<para>
									Additionally, running an incremental backup will update the backup folder in-place so no old backups will be kept if you choose to enable incremental backups.
